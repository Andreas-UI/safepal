# üì± SafePal - Campus Safety App

A mobile app built by students, for students. With this app, no one walks alone ‚Äî safety is instant, community-driven, and always within reach.

## Overview

Campus safety has always been a concern, especially during late hours, isolated areas, or emergencies where help is not instantly available. This project reimagines campus safety by combining **real-time incident reporting**, **community awareness**, and **smart alerts** into one unified mobile experience.

## üöÄ Features

  * *General Alert* ‚Üí minor issues (lost & found, maintenance).

  * *Safety/Warning Alert* ‚Üí suspicious behavior or hazards.

  * *Emergency/SOS Alert* ‚Üí critical emergencies requiring immediate help.

   Attach text + images for better context.

* **Interactive Map**
   Real-time campus map with **incident icons**.

  * Automatic clustering for crowded areas (k-means).

  * Tap icons to see detailed reports.

* **Smart Notifications**
Priority-based alerts:

  * *General* ‚Üí Logs only.

  * *Safety/Warning* ‚Üí Nearby users + Campus Security.

  * *SOS* ‚Üí Everyone + Security + Police.

* **Community Awareness**

  * See **who‚Äôs online** in real time.

  * Access a **live incident log** of today‚Äôs reports.

## Installation

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

> NOTE:: At the moment, this repository does not have the prototype but the base code for this app. Reproducing the app below will only show you the base of React Native Expo App.

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
